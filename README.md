## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a Computational Engineer dedicated to bridging the gap between complex physical phenomena and robust numerical simulations. My work sits at the intersection of FEM/FEA and CFD, with a deep-seated interest in the flexibility and power of unfitted Finite Element Methods.

## 🎓 Doctoral Research
I am currently completing my PhD, where I focused on developing unfitted FEM frameworks for the hydrodynamic modeling of floating structures. My research addressed the meshing bottleneck and the extension to offshore applications, specifically aiming to improve how we simulate the interaction between massive marine structures and the dynamic environments they inhabit.

Core Expertise: Unfitted / Immersed / Embedded methods, Potential Theory formulations for offshore Fluid-Structure Interaction, and Computational Fluid Dynamics.

The Mission: Making numerical modeling more efficient for complex geometries without the traditional "meshing headache".

## 🛠️ Research Focus & Interests
Unfitted FEM: Developing algorithms that handle complex and/or moving boundaries without conforming meshes. Specifically: AgFEM, CutFEM, SBM, WSBM, and GSBM.

Offshore Engineering: Modeling floating wind turbines, platforms, and wave energy converters.

Aero- and Hydrodynamics: Solving both low- and high-fidelity fluid problems.

# 💡 A Note on the PhD Code
The repositories highlighted below represent the culmination of my doctoral work. They transition from theoretical unfitted FEM formulations to practical, hydrodynamic solvers used for analysis of offshore structures.
